What is twilight?
===

twilight uses unicorn to exec Linux user space programs
But unlike usercorn, it actually uses the real Linux kernel to run syscalls
twilight + CLE + unicorn = qemu-user

1. Use cle (from angr) to load binary
2. Use unicorn to emulate binary
3. Use <<<shell process>>> to run syscalls

./run.py /bin/cat /etc/rc.local
